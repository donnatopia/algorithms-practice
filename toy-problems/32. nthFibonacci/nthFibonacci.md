# 32. Nth Fibonacci

## About the Problem

A Fibonacci sequence is a list of numbers that begins with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

For example, the first five Fibonacci numbers are:

  0 1 1 2 3

If n were 4, your function should return 3; for 5, it should return 5.

Write a function that accepts a number, n, and returns the nth Fibonacci number.

Use a recursive solution to this problem; if you finish with time left over, implement an iterative solution.

### Examples
