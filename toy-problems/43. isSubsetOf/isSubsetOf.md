# 43. Is Subset Of

## About the Problem

Make an array method that can return whether or not a context array is a subset of an input array.  To simplify the problem, you can assume that neither array will contain objects or arrays as elements within them.

NOTE: You should disregard duplicates in the set.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset for more on the definition of a
subset.

Extra Credit: Make the method work for arrays that contain objects and/or arrays as elements.

### Examples

| Example| Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `isSubsetOf(['commit','push'], ['commit','rebase','push','blame'])` | `true` |
| 2 | `isSubsetOf(['merge','reset','reset'], ['reset','merge','add','commit'])` | `true` |
