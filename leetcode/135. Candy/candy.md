There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

### Examples

| Example| Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `ratings = [1,0,2]` | `5` |
| 2 | `ratings = [1,2,2]` | `4` |

### Constraints:

- `n == ratings.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
- `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 10^4`
