# 23. Common Characters

## About the Problem

Write a function `f(a, b)` which takes two strings as arguments and returns a string containing the characters found in both strings (without duplication), in the order that they appeared in `a`.

Remember to skip spaces and characters you have already encountered!

### Extra Credit:

Extend your function to handle more than two input strings.

### Examples

| Example| Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `commonCharacters('acexivou', 'aegihobu')` | `'aeiou'` |
