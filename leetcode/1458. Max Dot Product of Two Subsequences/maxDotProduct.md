Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.

Return the maximum dot product between non-empty subsequences of `nums1` and `nums2` with the same length.

A subsequence of a array is a new array which is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, [2,3,5] is a subsequence of [1,2,3,4,5] while [1,5,3] is not).

### Examples

| Example| Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `nums1 = [2,1,-2,5], nums2 = [3,0,-6]` | `18` |
| 2 | `nums1 = [3,-2], nums2 = [2,-6,7]` | `21` |
| 3 | `nums1 = [-1,-1], nums2 = [1,1]` | `-1` |

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 500`
- `-1000 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`
