# 45. Prime Tester

## About the Problem

A prime number is a whole number that has no other divisors other than itself and 1.

Write a function that accepts a number and returns true if it's a prime number, false if it's not.

### Extra Credit

Write a function that generates a list of all prime numbers in a user-specified range (inclusive). If you're not quite sure where to start, check out the Sieve of Eratosthenes on Wikipedia. (And if you're feeling saucy, check out the Sieve of Atkin.)

### Examples

| Example| Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `2` | `true` |
| 2 | `1` | `false` |
