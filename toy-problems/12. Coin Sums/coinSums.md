# 12. Coin Sums

## About the Problem

In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:

- 1p piece
- 2p piece
- 5p piece
- 10p piece
- 20p piece
- 50p piece
- 100p (£1)
- 200p (£2)

It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

1 * £1 + 1 * 50p + 2 * 20p + 1 * 5p + 1 * 2p + 3 * 1p
How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?
