You have an undirected, connected graph of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given an array `graph` where `graph[i]` is a list of all the nodes connected with node `i` by an edge.

Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.

### Examples

| Example| Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `graph = [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]` | `4` |
| 2 | `graph = [[1],[0,2,4],[1,3,4],[2],[1,2]]` | `4` |

### Constraints:

- `n == graph.length`
- `1 <= n <= 12`
- `0 <= graph[i].length < n`
- `graph[i]` does not contain `i`.
- If `graph[a]` contains `b`, then `graph[b]` contains `a`.
- The input graph is always connected.
