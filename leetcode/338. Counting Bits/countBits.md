Given an integer `n`, return an array `ans` of length `n + 1` such that for each `i` (`0 <= i <= n`), `ans[i]` is the number of `1`'s in the binary representation of `i`.

### Examples

| Example| Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `n = 2` | `[0,1,1]` |
| 2 | `n = 5` | `[0,1,1,2,1,2]` |

### Constraints:

- `0 <= n <= 10^5`

### Follow Up:

- It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of `O(n log n)`. Can you do it in linear time `O(n)` and possibly in a single pass?
- Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like `__builtin_popcount` in C++)?
