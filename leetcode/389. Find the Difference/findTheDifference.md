You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.


### Examples

| Example| Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `s = "abcd", t = "abcde"` | `e` |
| 2 | `s = "", t = "y"` | `y` |

### Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `t.length == s.length + 1`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

### Stats
| Type | Metric | Percentile |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime | 62 ms | 46.56% |
| Memory | 43.68 MB | 72.93% |

### Time and Space Complexity
  - Time Complexity: `O((s * log(s)) + (t * log(t)))`
    - sorting dominates the time complexity
  - Space Complexity: `O(s + t)`
    - storing the sorted string is the dominant space

### Input, Output, Constraints, Edge (IOCE)

  - I: s and t are both strings
  - O: string that was added to s to become t
  - C: N/A
  - E: if s is empty string, then return t

### Strategy / Pseudocode
- Plan A (iterative):
  - sort s and t
  - if s is empty string => return t
  - iterate through s
    - if s and t at the current index don't match => return t at the current index
