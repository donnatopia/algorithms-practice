You are given a list of airline `tickets` where `tickets[i] = [fromi, toi]` represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.

All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `"JFK"`, thus, the itinerary must begin with `"JFK"`. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.

- For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.

You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.

### Examples

| Example| Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]` | `["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"]` |
| 2 | `tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]`| `["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]` |

### Constraints:

- `1 <= tickets.length <= 300`
- `tickets[i].length == 2`
- `fromi.length == 3`
- `toi.length == 3`
- `fromi` and `toi` consist of uppercase English letters.
- `fromi != toi`
