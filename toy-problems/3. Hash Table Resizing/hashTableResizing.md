# 3. Hash Table Resizing

## About the Problem

Create a hash table with `insert()`, `retrieve()`, and `remove()` methods.
Be sure to handle hashing collisions correctly.

Set your hash table up to double the storage limit as soon as the total number of items stored is greater than 3/4th of the number of slots in the storage array.

Resize by half whenever utilization drops below 1/4.
